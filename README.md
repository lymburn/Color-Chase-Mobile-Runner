# Color-Chase-Mobile-Platformer
Color Chase - Mind Trial is an iOS game made with C++ and the Cocos2d-x game engine. It is a simple runner where the goal of the player is to move a bird around, by tapping, and collecting balls of the correct color. There is the word of a color on the top, and the text has a color too. The goal is to collect the ball with the same color as the text outline, not the word itself. The word is simply meant to confuse the brain and make it harder for the player to get the correct color. A Youtube demo is shown below.

What I Learned:  
As part of my first year summer project, I wanted to do something fun while practicing my programming skills. Making games, especially mobile ones that could be shared with anyone around the world, seemed like a great hobby to pick up. After reading through a basic C++ book and making a copy of Reversi on desktop, I began looking into Cocos2d-x's engine to develop an iOS game. Throughout the project, I practiced and learned many concepts such as classes, containers, lambda functions...etc. With these concepts, I was able to implement key features such as parallax scrolling, collision detection, and difficulty levels. The most important thing I learned during this project is how to look through documentation in order to figure out problems.
